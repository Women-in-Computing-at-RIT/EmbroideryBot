## Hardware
This is the list of materials that went into the finished product. For each item there is a link to the website that we bought the item from or a description of the object.

### Sewing Machine
- Brother Project Runway CS5055PRW Sewing Machine. Honestly this machine is a little bit of an overkill. It was the only sewing machine that we had readily available without buying another one. The only thing you need from a sewing machine is that it can sew in a straight line and can have a free motion quilting foot attachment.
- Brother Free Motion Quilting Foot, SA129. This is the foot for our specific sewing machine. If you have a different machine, find a free motion quilting foot or darning foot.
