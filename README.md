## Hardware
This is the list of materials that went into the finished product. For each item there is a link to the website that we bought the item from or a description of the object.

### Sewing Machine
- Brother Project Runway CS5055PRW Sewing Machine. Honestly this machine is a little bit of an overkill. It was the only sewing machine that we had readily available without buying another one. The only thing you need from a sewing machine is that it can sew in a straight line and can have a free motion quilting foot attachment.
- Brother Free Motion Quilting Foot, SA129. This is the foot for our specific sewing machine. If you have a different machine, find a free motion quilting foot or darning foot.

### Platform
For the platform to hold the embroidery machine, we opted for just some [plywood](https://www.homedepot.com/p/12mm-Sande-Plywood-1-2-in-Category-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-Actual-0-472-in-x-48-in-x-96-in-454532/203414055) and [furring strips](https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-x-2-in-x-8-ft-Furring-Strip-Board-165360/202076422). For the embroidery machine platform, we used less than half the wood we ordered which means we have extra wood for other projects.

### 3D Printed Parts
For this project, we 3D printed six parts and four different hoops. The link to the download is in the References section.
